# Leaflet Widget Map

This project is a dynamic sensor and signal management application built using **Angular 19**. The application integrates with the **Leaflet.js** library to provide an interactive map interface for visualizing and managing sensor data and signals.

## Features
- Real-time signal updates for sensors displayed on a Leaflet map.
- Interactive widgets for updating temperature and humidity values with validation.
- Responsive UI for managing sensor data through popups.
- Seamless state management using `PopupState`.
- TailwindCSS for clean and responsive styling.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular 19**: Framework for building the application.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe, maintainable code.
- **Leaflet.js**: For rendering interactive maps.
- **TailwindCSS**: For modern and responsive UI design.
- **RxJS**: For managing real-time data streams and state.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For building a structured and styled UI.


# LeafletWidgetMap

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
